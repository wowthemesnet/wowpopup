2. Create New Popup
3. Customize your popup, then publish. Go to your website and see it in action!

## Notes
- when setting your popup, it is  recommended to work with "*show all the time*" option enabled, otherwise you may not be able to preview it several times. Also, don't forget to NOT select "*when user is logged in*" hide option because you will most likely be logged in and, again, you will not be able to test your popup. Once you're done and the settings are final you can then check these options if needed.
- images are for demo purposes.
